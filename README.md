# CustomMusic
A mod that allows loading of custom music into Spaceflight Simulator.

This mod WILL NOT WORK with the old third-party modloader. You will need to be on a version of the game with the official modloader.
# How to Use

**NOTE:** Music files must be in mp3, ogg, wav, or aiff format.

- Install CustomMusic.dll from the latest release into your SFS mod folder. 
- Open the game once. This will generate the necessary folders and config for the mod. 
- Reopen your SFS mod folder, then locate the "CustomMusic" folder.
- Close the game, then paste your music into the respective folder. ("World_PC" will play in space while in-game, "Build_PC" will play in build mode, "Home_PC" will play in the main menu.)
- Choose whether you want the game to include the vanilla music in the playlist using the built in Config menu.
