# CustomMusic
A mod that allows loading of custom music into Spaceflight Simulator.

This mod WILL NOT WORK with the old third-party modloader. You will need to be on a version of the game with the official modloader.
# How to Use

**NOTE:** Music files must be in .ogg (OGGVORBIS) format. You can convert your audio to .ogg format using [this online tool.](https://convertio.co/mp3-ogg/)

- Install CustomMusic.dll from the latest release into your SFS mod folder. 
- Open the game once. This will generate the necessary folders and config for the mod. 
- Reopen your SFS mod folder, then locate the "Custom Music" folder.
- Close the game, then paste your music into the respective folder. ("World" will play in the main menu and in space while in-game, "Build" will play in build mode.)
- Choose whether you want the game to include the default music in the playlist using `Config.txt`.
